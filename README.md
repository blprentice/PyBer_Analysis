# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze PyBer ridesharing data to identify disparities between city types and how those disparities could be addressed by PyBer leadership. It consists of two technical deliverables: 1. a Pandas summary DataFrame breaking out and displaying PyBer ridesharing data by city type (urban, suburban, and rural) and 2. a multiple line graph depicting total weekly fares for each city type.
